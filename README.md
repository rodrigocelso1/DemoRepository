## FinTech


Who are you? **Rodrigo** 
What is your background? **Business Administration** 
What are your career goals? **to be able to master large data financial analysis** 
Why did you choose FinTech as a career path? **I’m excited to learn how to read, research, recommend, and apply new technologies such as Blockchain, crypto market, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, as I strongly believe that it is the future of financial services. Knowing that risk management, anti-money laundry, security systems, etc., are in high demand I’d like to be prepared to handle any situation I might come across in the field**
